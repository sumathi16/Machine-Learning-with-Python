Create a new class, SMS_store. The class will instantiate SMS_store objects, similar to an inbox or outbox on a cellphone:

my_inbox = SMS_store()
This store can hold multiple SMS messages (i.e. its internal state will just be a list of messages). Each message will be represented as a tuple:

(has_been_viewed, from_number, time_arrived, text_of_SMS)
The inbox object should provide these methods:

my_inbox.add_new_arrival(from_number, time_arrived, text_of_SMS)
  # Makes new SMS tuple, inserts it after other messages
  # in the store. When creating this message, its
  # has_been_viewed status is set False.
 
my_inbox.message_count()
  # Returns the number of sms messages in my_inbox
 
my_inbox.get_unread_indexes()
  # Returns list of indexes of all not-yet-viewed SMS messages
 
my_inbox.get_message(i)
  # Return (from_number, time_arrived, text_of_sms) for message[i]
  # Also change its state to "has been viewed".
  # If there is no message at position i, return None
 
my_inbox.delete(i)     # Delete the message at index i
my_inbox.clear()       # Delete all messages from inbox
